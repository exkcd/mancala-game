    "In this assignment, you are tasked with implementing various functions for a Mancala game. The game is played on a board with specific rules, and you will need to implement the core game logic by completing the `play`, `valid_move`, and `winning_eval` functions. You are provided with the `init` and `display_board` functions. The assignment is divided into two parts:"

    "* The large pits at the end of the board are called Mancalas\n",
    "* Set up the board with 4 stones per small pit (none in the mancalas)\n",
    "* On every turn, select a pit on your side of the board that contains one or more stones,  then distribute its stones, one stone per pit, in an counter-clockwise direction until you have no stones remaining\n",
