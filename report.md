# Report: Mancala Game

Name(s): Alex Schwarz, Rey Stone

Project name: We Can Never Get It Back, Can We?

## Current state

For this project, we have chosen to simulate the game of Mancala, with the rules stated in the project overview. We have successfully implemented the Mancala game from a previous homework assignment, as well as took the creative liberty of adding some new functions to make sure the game ran properly. A list of those functions can be found below.

So far, both random players are working and fully functional. We have code in the `output.py` file that runs through one hundred Mancala games and then reports all of the statistics afterwards.
